# Moodle

This project is an app with the purpose of managing students, professors and lessons. It uses the principles of OOP.

Firstly, you need to sign up and enter some things about you. This app is just a demo, so there can only be 2 professors, one for Math and one for Chemistry.

As a student, you can check your grades and take tests.

As a professor, you can create tests, check the tests and grade your students.

I remind you that this project is not made for wrong inputs, so please be careful when you check it.
